About the Program:

-Students are written to a file as follows:
"studentID|GPA|facultyID|name|level|subject"

-Faculty are similarly written as follows:
"facultyID|name|level|subject|studentID1|studentID2|..."

-Student and Faculty ID's are randomly generated five (5) digit numbers

-All functions are working, assuming referential integrity is not broken in the loaded files
